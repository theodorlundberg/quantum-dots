# Automated data acquisition for dispersive readout of gate-defined quantum dots

In this repository, you'll find helpful code for
1) Live-plotting using QCoDeS
2) Finding and storing the coordinates and dimensions of interdot charge transitions
3) Optimisation of the reflectometry probe frequency

If any of this code is used to acquire data that is to be published, please acknowlegde the use of this code in the publications.
